Last year, Dave Thomas (a.k.a, Pragmatic Dave) posted a blog entry titled ["Agile is Dead (Long Live Agility)"](http://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile/) in which he argues that Agile has become a buzzword -- a marketing term. The opportunistic swooped in and monetized the simple concepts suggested in the [Manifesto for Agile Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/).  His post is a great read and the video below is a great watch.

The take-away is this: there is no cookie-cutter solution.  If you rely on "experts" to provide you with the perfect methodology for developing software then you're probably going to miss the mark.
